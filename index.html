                            We, at MAIT aim to make coding accessible to all and actively implement ways to integrate the female demographic; which as of now is extremely under - represented in the tech industry.We also envision a future where we can bring people from different cultures and different walks of life, together on a single platform, where they can contribute without the stigma of being under- represented.
                            To effectuate our aspirations, we are pleased to announce that special preference shall be given to an all female participants team and they shall receive remarkable gifts if they manage to win the competition.
